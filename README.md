TypeScript Puppeteer Wait For Navigation With Link to Section of Page Demo
==========================================================================

```
npm install -g puppeteer
npm run demo
```

Note: since puppeteer needs to download a very huge Chrome which makes the installation quite slow,
I prefer install puppeteer globally and link it to this project before running.
